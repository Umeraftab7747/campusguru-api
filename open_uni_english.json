Reading strategies include: cognitive skills, enrichment of vocabulary and linguistic structures, and understanding organization patterns of academic texts.\nThe course includes academic articles on a variety of topics in sociology, political science and economics. The difficulty level, length and complexity of the articles increase gradually during the course.\nThe learning process consists of three stages: Pre-reading (navigating the text): initial reading to gain a general impression and advance mapping of the central points and the relevant terms and expressions; Reading in depth: detailed and focused in-depth reading of arguments and conclusions; Post-reading: summary, processing and rereading to internalize content, examine the integration of the new information with prior knowledge and apply tools acquired in the learning process. The course includes a mid-term examination.\n1\nStudents who enrolled in the past in A-level courses: English Reading Comprehension for Science (30101) or English: Reading Comprehension for Humanities and Social Sciences (30102), without having taken a proficiency test and failed, may not re-enroll in the course. These students must take the Amir exam and enroll in the level � A, B, C, D or E � according to the placement.",

It is intended for students who studied high school Mathematics on the 3-point level, and those who studied Mathematics on the 4- or 5-point level but have not reviewed the material for a long time, or whose matriculation grades were low.\nThe workshop is taught face-to-face over a period of eight weeks, 4 hours a week. The workshop is not for credit or any other entitlement. It is offered twice a year: once during the summer semester (in preparation for the fall semester) and once during the second half of the fall semester (towards the spring semester). The content of the workshop sometimes takes into consideration the unique needs of specific groups of participants.\nTopics: Basic algebra � short multiplication formulas, laws of exponents, factorization, solving simple equations; Set theory � notations and operations on sets; Functions � basic concepts, linear functions, quadratic functions, graphs of simple functions, exponential functions, logarithmic functions; Trigonometry � when necessary; Derivatives.",

As part of the methodology courses, psychology and education students learn what is required of a researcher in this discipline: principles of planning a study, collecting and processing data and drawing conclusions. The course enables psychology students to experience research as participants in studies.\nTo pass the course, students are required to actively participate in a research study for three hours. This course is a prerequisite for Personality: Theory and Research (10269) and Cognitive Psychology (10264) and for advanced courses in psychology and education.\nDescription of research: For the most part, students participate in two types of studies: laboratory studies conducted mainly in the psychology laboratory located on the Open University campus (in most experiments students perform written or computer tasks) or studies based on questionnaires and/or interviews. The studies are conducted as part of the research/scientific work of faculty members in the Department of Education and Psychology or as part of the empirical studies conducted by psychology students as the basis for seminar papers.\nAll research involving human participants is approved by the Ethics Committee to ensure that it complies with the ethical principles of research in psychology.",

The material is drilled through assignments checked by the tutor. There is no final exam and participation is not mandatory. The workshop is offered twice a year, in the spring and summer semesters.\nTopics: Reading graphs � especially those describing place, time and velocity. Vectors � operations with vectors, equilibrium problems; the concepts of position, time, velocity and acceleration. Newton�s second law � the concept of mass; units of force, distance and time.

Each text enables students to experience reading, hearing, speaking and writing in-depth on a specific topic, thus enriching their vocabulary and improving their skills.\nThe workshop is offered in two intensive formats: classroom tutorials and virtual tutorials (participation from home).",

The assignments require implementation of the software studied and include a final project that combines all the material studied in the course.\nSystem requirements: PC with Hebrew support, Windows (Windows 98 and above); CD-ROM; sound card, modem, and an internet connection.\nTopics: Introduction to the computer, internet communication and informatics; Windows operating system; Microsoft Word � word processing; the Internet and its applications; Microsoft Excel electronic spreadsheets; Microsoft PowerPoint presentations.\n1\nStudents can take an exemption exam instead of taking the course.

The course provides tools for understanding and critical reading of academic texts.\nThe course includes academic articles on a variety of topics in the humanities and social sciences. The difficulty level, length and complexity of the articles increase gradually during the course.\nThe learning process consists of three stages: Pre-reading (navigating the text): initial reading to gain a general impression and advance mapping of the central points and the relevant terms and expressions; Reading in depth: detailed and focused in-depth reading of arguments and conclusions; Post-reading: summary, processing and rereading to internalize content, examine the integration of the new information with prior knowledge and apply tools acquired in the learning process.

This experience enables students to determine their affinity to the field, expand their experience and knowledge and consider their suitability to this type of work.\nStudents are placed in various institutions engaged in clinical psychology for at least two hours weekly (in accordance with the requirements of the institution) and receive individual or group supervision from the institution staff. In addition, there are group meetings led by professional psychologists for students placed in different institutions. Students are required to submit periodic reports to the host institution in accordance with its requirements. At the end of the year, students submit a similar final report to the Open University advisor. The student receives a pass/fail grade at the end of the course.\nAdmission requirements: Not everyone is suited for clinical work with people. Therefore, course admittance is not assured and depends on the decision of the course staff following a selection process. If it becomes evident to the hosting institution supervisor or to the Open University advisor during the internship that a student is not suited for the treatment work to which s/he is assigned, the University may terminate the student�s participation in the program.\nTuition and registration procedures: As the course is intended to enable students to gain experience in treatment but does not grant academic credit, it is not included in the total tuition units accumulated towards the cumulative and uniform tuition balance. Due to the unique nature of the course and its relation to hospitals and other institutions, Open University course change, postponement and cancellation procedures do not apply. Note: The number of students is limited.",
